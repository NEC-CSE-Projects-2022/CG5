## **Dataset Overview**

**Total Records:**
Contains thousands of grape leaf images (exact number based on dataset version present in Kaggle) ([Kaggle][1])

**Labeled Records:**
All images are labeled according to disease type or healthy class ([Kaggle][1])

**Classes:**
Common classes include:

* *Black Rot*
* *Esca (Black Measles)*
* *Leaf Blight*
* *Healthy Leaves*
  (4 main categories typically found in grape leaf datasets) ([Kaggle][2])

**Annotation Type:**
Image-level class labels — no bounding boxes (classification task) ([Kaggle][2])

## **Features Used**

**Feature 1:**
Visual leaf texture characteristics (spots, lesions)

**Feature 2:**
Color changes (discoloration due to disease)

**Feature 3:**
Shape and edge variation caused by infections
